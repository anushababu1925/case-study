    <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
    <P>Within the vast landscape of the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) website, lies a specific focus—Canada Dental Benefit, an essential resource for users seeking dental care support. However, navigating this section proves challenging, with its complex interface leading to confusion and frustration. As UX designers, our goal was clear—to create a seamless and user-friendly experience for those seeking dental benefits, ensuring a smoother journey through the Canada Dental Benefit section.</P>

<div class="introduction">
    <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4> 
    <p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is the federal government's revenue service in Canada. <br><br>

        This case study centers around optimizing the user experience of the CRA's online platform, with a specific focus on the Canada Dental Benefit section.</p>
</div>
<div class="PROBLEM">
    <h4>PROBLEM</h4> 
    <h3>
        Navigating the website and it’s complex page structure was frustrating and confusing for the users. 
    </h3>
    <p> The current website's navigation system, with its complex and tangled structure, poses significant challenges for users, resulting in a frustrating and confusing experience. 
        In simpler terms, the website's layout and organization make it difficult for users to find what they are looking for easily. Users may get lost or struggle to navigate to their desired sections. As a result, browsing through the website becomes time-consuming and confusing, leaving users dissatisfied with their overall experience.</p>
</div>
<div class="RESEARCH-PAIN-POINTS">
    <h4>RESEARCH: PAIN POINTS</h4>
    <p> During the initial phase, we conducted interviews with potential users, gaining valuable insights when they were asked  about their experiences applying for dental benefits for their children.

        Analyzing the data, we identified the frustrations highlighted by the users. These frustrations were then used to prioritize the most significant pain points for the redesign, which are outlined below:</p>
</div>
<div class="textbox-container">
    <div class="text-box">
        <p>“I couldn’t go back to CRA homepage Navigating back   took me to the homepage of Canada.ca -was pretty surprised abt the navigation.” <br>
            -100% users</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box">
        <p>“Menu Bar has all the Canada.ca content rather than focusing on CRA’s own sub-headings and divisions.”<br>
            -60% users</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box">
        <p>“They are making me read more wherein I prefer visual cues more.”<br>
            -60% users</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box">
        <p>“What if I make a mistake or I do have a doubt, I don’t get to see the bot anymore. I'll have to leave the page to contact CRA.”<br>
            -80% users</p>

    <div class="FEATURE-PRIORITIZATION ">
        <h4>FEATURE PRIORITIZATION</h4>
        <p>We identified four high-priority, high-impact features using our feature prioritization matrix. This matrix was developed through a voting system and aligned with the pain points identified in our user personas.</p>

    The results of the earlier interviews , shows that 20% of the users are regulars of CRA, and their average navigation time to reach Canada Dental Benefits is 11.82 seconds. Introducing major changes to the user flow would affect the familiarity, as this website is frequently used by 8,414,412 people in Canada each month.</p>

        <h4>WIREFRAMES</h4>
        <p>Our goal was to address the user’s concerns by incorporating user-driven design changes. We have created desktop and mobile wireframes that aim to strike a balance between a better user flow and preserving the familiarity of the website. These wireframes were crafted based on the feedback received directly from users.</p>
